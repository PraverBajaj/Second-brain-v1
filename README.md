# Second Brain - A Smart Content Organizer

## Introduction

In today's digital era, information is scattered across multiple platforms—Twitter threads, YouTube videos, Google Docs, and more. We often save links, but they get lost in endless bookmarks, notes, or browser tabs. **Second Brain** is here to solve that problem by providing a centralized, intelligent knowledge management system.

## Key Features

- **Unified Content Collection**
  - Save links from Twitter, YouTube, Google Docs, and more.
  - Automatically extract metadata, thumbnails, and key insights for each saved resource.

- **Visual Organization with Card-Based UI**
  - Easily navigate and manage saved content.
  
- **Privacy & Offline Access**
  - Users can self-host their instance to keep control over their data.
  - Support for offline access to previously fetched content.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (TypeScript) + TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
