# Second Brain - A Smart Content Organizer

## Introduction

In today's digital era, information is scattered across multiple platformsâ€”Twitter threads, YouTube videos, Google Docs, and more. We often save links, but they get lost in endless bookmarks, notes, or browser tabs. **Second Brain** is here to solve that problem by providing a centralized, intelligent knowledge management system.

## Key Features

- **Unified Content Collection**
  - Save links from Twitter, YouTube, Google Docs, and more.
  - Automatically extract metadata, thumbnails, and key insights for each saved resource.

- **Visual Organization with Card-Based UI**
  - Easily navigate and manage saved content.
  
- **Privacy & Offline Access**
  - Users can self-host their instance to keep control over their data.
  - Support for offline access to previously fetched content.

## Tech Stack
